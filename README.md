Mood Recommender App
Welcome to the Mood Recommender App! This Spring project utilizes HTML, JSON, and Java to recommend you a movie, a song, and a K-drama based on your mood input. The app takes into account four mood options: Happy, Sad, Calm, and Excited. Please note that the mood input is case sensitive.
